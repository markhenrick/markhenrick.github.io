So the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is running again this year. I'll be trying to solve each day in Java, Haskell, and Python. All my code will be in [this repo](https://github.com/markhenrick/adventofcode) and my commentary on the solutions will be in [the "writeups" folder](https://github.com/markhenrick/adventofcode/tree/master/2020/writeups) rather than on this site.
